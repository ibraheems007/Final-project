# Final-project
“De novo study of planet movement based on sky images and Newton’s model” is a comprehensive guide merging classical physics and computational techniques to decode the complex choreography of celestial bodies. From foundational principles like gravity and kinematics to intricate discussions on celestial bodies and their movements, we delve deep into celestial mechanics.
Our unique perspective investigates celestial phenomena from Earth's standpoint, exploring the differences between actual and apparent dimensions of celestial bodies, and the influence of Earth's atmosphere on sky images. We also present state-of-the-art techniques for automatic detection and tracking of sky objects using machine learning and image processing.
The book features a detailed walkthrough of our de novo study, bridging sky images with planet movement predictions based on Newton's mechanics and gravity model. Complete with practical case studies and vivid illustrations, Our project offers a compelling journey into the computational exploration of celestial movements, designed for stargazers, astronomers, and scientists alike.
